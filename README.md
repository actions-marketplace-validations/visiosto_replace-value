### Set up the Project Locally

**Via HTTPS:** If you’re checking out sources as read-only, HTTPS works best.

    git clone https://github.com/visiosto/replace-value.git

**Via SSH:** If you’re planning on regularly making direct commits, cloning over SSH may provide a better experience (it requires [uploading SSH keys to GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/))

    git clone git@github.com:visiosto/replace-value.git

**Via GitHub CLI:** If you work chiefly with GitHub, using the official [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) may provide the best experience.

    gh repo clone visiosto/replace-value
